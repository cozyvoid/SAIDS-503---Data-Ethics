# SAIDS-503---Data-Ethics
SIADS 503 003 SS 2025

Course Overview
This class will teach you to recognize where ethical issues can arise when applying data science to real world problems. It will bring more analytic precision to ethical debates about the role that data science, machine learning, and artificial intelligence play in consequential decision-making in commerce, employment, finance, healthcare, education, policing, and other areas. Largely through discussions of case studies, we will focus on ways to conceptualize, measure, and mitigate harm in data-driven decision-making. You will learn to think critically about how to plan and evaluate a data science project with ethical concerns in mind, and how to cope with novel challenges for which there are often no easy answers or established solutions.

To do so, you will learn key technical, ethical, policy, and legal terms and concepts that are relevant to ethical assessment in data science; learn about some of the common approaches and emerging tools for mitigating or managing these ethical concerns; and gain exposure to readings that will help you understand the current ethical and regulatory environment and to anticipate future developments. Ultimately, the class will teach you how to reason through these problems in a systematic manner and how to justify and defend your approach to dealing with them.

Prerequisites
The prerequisite for SIADS 503 Data Science Ethics is the successful completion of SIADS 501, “Being a Data Scientist.”

Learning Outcomes
Understand the most critical concepts and principles of ethics that apply to data science and outcomes.
Identify potential harms of data collection, aggregation, analysis, and use typically found in applied data science contexts.
Identify potential causes of bias and discrimination and evaluate whether a data-driven system is discriminatory to any system stakeholders.
Remain vigilant of potential discriminatory outcomes when building data science solution(s); engage in multidisciplinary conversations to actively work against discrimination for solution(s) stakeholders.
Understand, identify, and discuss how data and algorithms have been used to perpetuate racism; Introduce how to correct, combat, and prevent racism using anti-racist data and algorithmic practices.
Apply course concepts to written ethical assessments and recommendations (e.g. a memorandum) for applied data science use cases (e.g. automated decision-making systems).
Articulate reasoning behind the most important ethical challenges of data science as applied to course domains of privacy, bias/classification, provenance/aggregation, power imbalances, accountability/consequences.

Course Schedule
This course begins on Friday, June 27, and ends on Thursday, July 24.

Weekly Quizzes and Writing Assignments are due on Thursdays at 11:59 pm EDT (time zone is Ann Arbor, Michigan; Eastern Time). Please message @RuthCorddry if you have questions about the assignment or are facing circumstances affecting your coursework.

The extra credit assignment and revised assignment (optional) are due on Thursday, July 24  at 11:59 pm EDT (time zone is Ann Arbor, Michigan; Eastern Time). The instructions for these assignments and the links to submit them are in the week 4 module.

All readings are located within Modules as links. In some cases, you may be directed to the U-M Library website and need to sign-in using your U-M email address and password. Please make sure you are using your University of Michigan email when accessing PDFs of readings or the library

Please contact @RuthCorddry if you encounter circumstances that make it difficult to complete coursework or if you have any questions about the course.

Course Structure
Each week, this course consists of recorded lectures, required and recommended readings, and two student hours with the instructor(s). Lectures consist of overview material about concepts as well as the discussion of case studies. In addition, a guest speaker will visit or we will take a field trip. This provides one or more additional recorded lectures, interviews, or conversations. Lectures supplement but do not always review or duplicate the readings; readings supplement but do not always duplicate the lectures. That means some of the course content is available only from a lecture or a reading. For instance a concept may not be mentioned in a lecture, but it may be the key point of a reading. Students are still responsible for that material. 

A low-stakes, open-book weekly quiz provides an incentive to keep up with the readings/lecture content. Although Coursera shows a time in the quiz page, this is an automated estimation. Note that there is not a time limit for the quiz, but you have only one attempt each quiz. You may begin the quiz then leave and finish later.

The primary work of the course is one assignment each week. Thorough instructions are included in the Assignments and Assessments section of each week's content. A homework guide for each assignment (linked in the instructions) can help you get started and organize your thoughts. Our goal is to return trading and written feedback at least three days before the next deadline so you can use the feedback to guide your next submission. However, some circumstances may make grading take longer. This is especially true the first week when calibrating grading takes more time.

Revised Assignment
You have the opportunity to revise and resubmit one of the first three assignments. This is not required, but is rather an opportunity to recover from a misstep and earn additional points by responding to feedback and improving your submission. Your revised assignment may earn up to the median score for that assignment. The assignment will be graded using the same rubric as the initial submission. We do not begin with the median grade and then subtract points, but instead add points as usual and award points up to and including the median score. Points above the median score will not be reflected in your grade. The median score for each assignment will be posted on Slack after the grades are released. The instructions for the revised assignment are in the week 4 Assignments and Assessments section of Coursera. There is also a link there to submit the revised assignment. Do not resubmit an assignment to the original assignment!

The revised assignment is due on the last day of class at 11:59 p.m. EDT.

Extra Credit Assignment

Extra credit up to 2.5% will be earned by writing a scenario, quiz question(s), answers, and explanation(s) similar to what you encounter each week in the quiz. The instructions for this assignment and the link to submit it to Gradescope are in the week 4 module.

Regrade Requests

Instructors may make mistakes. If you think there is an error in your grading, please submit a regrade request through Gradescope. Please  describe why you think that the initial grading was incorrect. The entire assignment will be regraded, applying all elements of the grading rubric. Your grade could go up or down. The instructions for this assignment and the link to submit it to Gradescope are in the week 4 module.
